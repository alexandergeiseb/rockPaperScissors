# rockPaperScissors

goal: Implement a simple rock-paper-scissors game.

challenge: accepted :)

### rules
- Rock beats Scissors
- Paper beats Rock
- Scissors beats Paper

### implementation
- best of 3 (or 5) rounds, win.
- following the rules (as mentioned above), to get a point, either player must play a valid move over the other player's move.
- if both players play the same move, it's a tie and no points are awarded.
-and of course, if a player plays an invalid move, they lose the round.

#### extra features for future development and fun
